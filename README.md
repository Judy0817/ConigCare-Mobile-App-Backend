## Overview
A ground-breaking tool called the Text to Sign Language Converter was created to help people who primarily communicate through sign language or have hearing loss close communication gaps. This program provides an easy-to-use interface for turning text messages into GIF animations in Sign Language by utilizing contemporary technologies like Flutter, Dart, and FastAPI.

## Technologies Used
- Languages
  
  <ul>
     <li>Dart - For frontend mobile application development</li>
     <li>Python - For implementing the backend logic with FastAPI and PIL (Python Imaging Library), </li>
  </ul>

- Tools
  
  <ul>
    <li>Android Studio, Visual Studio Code</li>
  </ul>

- Libraries

   <ul>
    <li>tempfile, PIL (Python Imaging Library) , pyrebase, Numpy</li>
  </ul>

- Database/Storage:

  <ul>
    <li>Firebase Storage - utilized as the database/storage solution to store image assets that correspond to the alphabet's letters, offering the application scalability and dependability.
 </li>
  </ul>

## Development Setup
To set up the Text to Sign Language Converter for development:

1. Clone the repository containing the Flutter frontend and FastAPI backend.
2. Set up Firebase Storage and configure access credentials.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for both Flutter and FastAPI as specified in their respective files (pubspec.yaml for Flutter and requirements.txt for FastAPI).
4. Run the backend server locally using FastAPI.
5. Run the Flutter application on a simulator or physical device for testing and development.
